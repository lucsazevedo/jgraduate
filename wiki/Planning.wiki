#summary A page for planning the plugin

= Introduction =

This jQuery plugin will allow a user to pick a gradient and return it as either:

  * an unattached SVG gradient DOM element ([http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/painting.html#LinearGradientElement linearGradient] or [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/painting.html#RadialGradientElement radialGradient])
  * raw text representing a CSS3 WebKit-style gradient

= Roadmap =

== 0.2.x ==

The next version will probably be the first actually useful version and may include:

  * pluggable color picker ?
  * radial gradient (done as tab?)
  * option to return Webkit-style gradient as text?
  * spinners for picking opacity, x1, y1, x2, y2, cx, cy, fx, fy ?

== 0.1.x ==

  * Released 2009-06-22 
  * The first version will be a proof-of-concept.  The picker will only allow a simple linear gradient with a start/stop offset to be defined:
    * the left-hand side will show the current gradient (drawn as inline SVG rect)
    * the right-hand side will have:
      * Ok/Cancel buttons
      * Start definition: x, y, color, offset input boxes
      * End definition: x, y, color, offset input boxes
    * the x,y,offset inputs will be validated as a number between 0.0 and 1.0
    * the color inputs will be validated as a string #NNNNNN (where N is a digit 0..9)
    * returns an unattached linearGradient node
