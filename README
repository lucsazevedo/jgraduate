jGraduate - A jQuery plugin for picking gradients

Ok, so my current thoughts after sleeping on it for a night are:

- remove jPicker from SVG-edit
- add jPicker to jGraduate (in other words, jGraduate will use jPicker)
- jGraduate's dialog will have two tabs: Color (show jPicker) and
Linear Gradient
- jGraduate will use jPicker to allow user to pick the stop color and
opacity instead of having them type it in
- jGraduate's dialog will also need to have an opacity slider (just
like jPicker's) for the overall opacity of the fill/stroke, I can just
copy the code from jPicker
- user should be able to drag the stops around instead of forcing them
to type in the coordinates
- jGraduate requires a div to be set during setup
- jGraduate will automatically fill this div with a tiny SVG document:

 <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <linearGradient id="XXX_grad"/>
   <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(XXX_grad)"/>
 </svg>

The XXX will be substituted for the id of the div.
- update SVG-edit to bring up jGraduate's dialog (defaulting to solid color tab)

This will be very clean to use from SVG-edit perspective.
Unfortunately, this is a lot of work :(
